# Egocentric_Project---2025


### Important update and reminder

As it seem to be a problem with getting access to ego4d, here's a link to a zip file with the annotations and features. It's a temporary workaround to the issue with the official credentials.
You will need to modify the code in such a way that it doesn't try to download them but uses your google drive account (if you upload the file there) or any other way you may prefer.
